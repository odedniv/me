Hey there!

My name is Oded Niv, and you've stumbled upon my website.
You can find my blog posts by navigating to the other tabs, I hope they are useful for you!

You can also find what I'm up to on [linkedin.com/in/odedniv](https://linkedin.com/in/odedniv),
and what I've done on [github.com/odedniv](https://github.com/odedniv).
I'm most probably not looking for a new role right now,
but if you're curious you can check out my [resume.odedniv.me](https://resume.odedniv.me).
